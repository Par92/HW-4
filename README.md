Code Quiz
- Built a timed coding quiz with several multiple-choice questions.
- User is prompted to start the quiz.
- Then they are presented with a multiple choice question and a timer begins a countdown.
- If the user clicks the correct answer,  they are presented with another question and their score increases at an interval of 1.
- If the User clicks the wrong answer, they have 2 seconds removed from their timer.
- When either the timer or the questions run out, the user is prompted to input their initials.
- Then their score is recorded and displayed in the high-score box.
- At this point the game resets and the user is able to play again.
